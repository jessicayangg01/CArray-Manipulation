# CArray-Manipulation

This code will consist of seven (7) parts dealing with a single array. 
To initialize the assignment, compute the number of elements in the array and print out the size. 

Part 1: Print out the array
Simply print the array out exactly as it is stored. 

Part 2: Print the array in reverse order
Print the array out as it is stored, but in reverse order (last element printed first, second last, next, etc.
note: Do NOT change the actual array, just print it out in reverse. 

Part 3: Find the smallest value currently stored in the array
Traverse the entire array and find the lowest of all the values in the array. Print out the value and the actual position in the array the value was found
note: NOT the index of the value, but where it is in the array. (i.e. 63 is in the 2nd position). 

Part 4: Add all the value in the array to compute the total (sum) of all the values Print the equation and the result all on one line (including the addition symbol).
note: remember the last value does NOT have a ‘plus’ (+) sign after. 

Part 5: Copy the original array into a new array, but in reverse order Declare (but do not initially define) a new array. Write code that will copy the values from the original array into the new array, BUT in reverse order. So, the last element of the original array is the first element of the new array. They second last element of the original array is now the second element of the new array, etc. 

Part 6: Switch just the First and the Last elements of the array Switch the value from the first position on the array with the value in the last position. The rest of the array remains unchanged. 

Part 7: Sort the array into ascending (lowest to highest) order Using the concepts from the previous parts above, change the original array so the elements are now in ascending order.
